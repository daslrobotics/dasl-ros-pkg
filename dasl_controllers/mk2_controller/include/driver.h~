/*
 * In this example we will set parameters for each servo based on information stored
 * in the URDF robot description. Because the base class was designed to use the robot
 * description information, there are very few code changes. The only difference
 * is the custom 'init_actuator_' function now makes use of information obtained
 * from the robot description instead of using hard-coded defaults. The only extra
 * work really involved is in the creation of the robot description file itself.
 *
 * Additionally, we will explore the initialization process in detail. In the first
 * two examples, the convenience function 'init()' was used. Here we will perform
 * initialization by manually calling helper functions provided by the base class.
